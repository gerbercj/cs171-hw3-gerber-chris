# Take a look at the elements that are added to the <g> element.

# 1. Name the HTML element (type and class) that represents the interactive area.

A `rect` of class `background` is created which displays the crosshairs to indicate that the brushing can occur.

# 2. Name the HTML element (type and class) that is used for representing the selection.

A `rect` of class `extent` is created which shows the current selection.

# 3. What are the other DOM elements for?

There are also two groups (`g`) of class `resize` that allow for modifying the size of the selection. These each contain a small `rect`.
