The visualization that I created was ultimately based upon my first thought, but with the addition of brushing. This design has a small graph to show the percent difference between data and a consensus value, and a large graph to show the absolute difference. It uses a brush on the smaller graph to zoom in the larger graph to more clearly show the absolute differences. By zooming along both axes, we display the greatest visual separation. This graph achieves several key goals:

1. Consensus lines are easily distinguished.
1. Real and calculated is distinguishable.
1. Screen real estate is optimized by zooming in to show as much data as possible.
1. Both absolute and percentage differences are easily visualized.
